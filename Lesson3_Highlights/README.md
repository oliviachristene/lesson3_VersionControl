## Student Name:  
(Olivia Hrbek)

## Project Description:
(In this assignment, I was able to become more familiar with Cloud9 and breifly got to understand Git. I discussed the basics elements of Git, but believe working Git will give me a better understanding of the application.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version Control Systems are necessary for graphic designers and developers to do their work effectively and not lose any of the necessary information.)
2. (While Version Control Systems allow developers to save their work efficiently, Git is a more popular application. Git allows you to committ to more finalized work instead of saving everything and works quicker and more productively when multiple developers are working on one file.)
3. (Setting up a GitHub account is fairly simple and quick. You are able to create a free account and personalize it.)
