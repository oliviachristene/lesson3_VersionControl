            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Think about creating a document on Microsoft Word. As you write paragraphs, you are constantly saving it, in hopes that you don't lose any of your work. This saving mechanism is what Version Control is. Version Control is a recording system that saves the changes that you make to a file or set of files. This allows you to go back to specific states or versions of your file. If there is ever a problem with a certain image or file, you can easily go back to its previous states and see where it might have gone wrong and how to possibly fix it. There are three types of version control systems; local version control system, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems. They are each used for different developers, whether it be working alone or with different developers on different systems. These systems allow for graphic and web designers to work more efficiently and collaboratively. Working for a technology company, many of the computer engineers used version control systems to make sure their work was never lost and allow several engineers to work on the same file. When trying to comprehend what a version control system entirely was, they described it as a family tree.   </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Git</b>
                <span class="text-muted">How is it different?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When discussing version control systems, we mentioned how these systems record changes to each file. Git doesn't entirely look at its files this way. Instead, Git looks at its data as a series of snapshots. Once you save a file, Git 'screenshots' what the file looks like in that moment and stores it. This makes it more like a mini filesystem. Git is more important for developers because it is quicker to take a snapshot than to record data, you are able to commit to useful information, and you do not have to be connected to a network. This is why Git is so important to developers.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What do they do?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories are where Git stores your committed changes of a file. The two ways of obtaining a Git respository are either taking a directory that is not been used under version control and converting it into a Git repository or copying an already existing Git repository and work with that. Both will allow you to get to work and starting committing to changes on your file. Using an existing repository is most likely an easier option since you will just command the terminal 'git clone' and the name of the existing file. Git repositories are, in a sense, like Microsoft Word's save button. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Status of Git files.</b>
                <span class="text-muted">Are they tracked, untracked, or what? </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After setting up your Git repository, you now need to record changes to your file from your working directory. In your working directory, your file can either hold a status of tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that Git recognizes in the last snapshot, while untracked files are files that are in the directory but not committed and in the last snapshot. One effect of Git is that you can check the status of your file and be able to see if it has been modified or committed for the Git repository. This is beneficial for developers to be able to manually check where they are within a file instead of committing to states that may not be finalized. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>GitHub Account</b>
                <span class="text-muted">How do I set up my account? </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most important part of Git is setting up the account. None of the cool and convenient perks of having Git would matter until one sets up their free account. One must choose a username and password, as well as connecting your email so that Git can track your commits. Just like any of your social media accounts, you are able to update and personalize your account by changing your avatar and replacing it with a picture of your choosing. One of the other great effects of Github is their two factor authentication option. While this is not required, it is preferred by many developers. Github will ask you for two forms of authentication when trying to access your account. With the rise in computer and account hacking, this feature is almost entirely necessary to keep your work safe.</p>
